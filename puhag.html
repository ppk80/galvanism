                Constant buzzing, lines entangling into each other forming a canopy forming a clearing for a magenta sky. A transmission tower blinking, overlooking. I need to get there at a certain time. What time is it? I seem to have misplaced my watch. I dislike the way they hug my wrists. Like a fever at night. I can almost feel my skin prickling, like as a hand or a foot has fallen asleep or has started to wake up, or a subtler version of static from rubbing balloons. A page of newspaper from last year: 20 sugatan sa bomba. My grandmother has lost feeling on one side of her body. Can’t afford to get her looked at in another timeline where we can the doctors ran several tests and cannot say what it is. The rustling of garbage bags at this hour the sound of six thousand people kneeling. My silhouette looking like a walking turtle because of my backpack. I have somewhere I need to get to. Turning the corner, the transmission tower almost leaning, the same size it was. The sound of wasps.

As, for example, for a cord ABCD, the knowledge of glass is communicated by means of what awakens first: A moves, from afar, D. And the same holds true of all the other hauntings of our rivers. The boatpeople waving underneath the condominium complex, as I just happened to have seen, which could conceal automatons. Yet, I know them as tomorrow’s people: not by seeing them through my eyes but solely by the judgement of days. On occasion my belief of the nature of wax is most occurrent and at-hand, returning the greeting over the bank. Did I believe I knew it by my common senses, or is my knowledge restored as wax unmelted? I now know that this is the circuitry of the oikos. The kettle whistles then the galloping of the TDMA modulation, which tumbles from the nose into the bedroom, the mountain of ceiling fans, through nested forwarding addresses, nimbostratus system.
